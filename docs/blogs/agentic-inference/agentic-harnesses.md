# Full-Stack Optimizations for Agentic Harnesses with Dynamo

Pointing an agent harness at a new backend is easy. Making the harness feel correct is harder.

Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Codex all depend on details that live above raw token generation: prompt shape, replay order, stream semantics, model metadata, and tool-call readiness. Get those details wrong and the failure mode is not just uglier JSON. It is broken cache reuse, idle tool loops, and clients that behave as if the model is slower or less reliable than it really is.

Our [first post](./agentic-inference.md) focused on the architecture underneath agentic inference: the frontend, the router, and KV cache management. This post stays closer to the harness boundary. The question here is simpler and more practical:

What had to change in Dynamo to make real agent harnesses like Claude Code, OpenClaw, and Codex feel correct, cache-efficient, and fast?

Claude Code is the main anchor throughout. It puts pressure on nearly every layer at once: a large reusable system prompt, Anthropic-flavored API expectations, interleaved reasoning and tool calls, and long-running sessions where small compatibility gaps compound quickly. OpenClaw broadens the story to long-lived and background loops. Codex gives us the `v1/responses` side of the same problem.

## Tiny Setup

This is not a setup post, but it helps to show the shape of the integration and the knobs that mattered in the experiments.

For Claude Code, the setup we actually used is just an SSH tunnel plus a few environment variables:

```bash
autossh -M 0 -f -N \
  -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
  -o ServerAliveInterval=15 \
  -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  <gpu-node>

ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy \
CLAUDE_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4 \
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4 \
claude --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4
```

For OpenClaw, it is the same tunnel pattern with a much thinner client setup:

```bash
autossh -M 0 -f -N \
  -L 8000:localhost:8000 \
  -o ServerAliveInterval=15 \
  -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
  <gpu-node>

ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
pnpx openclaw
```

For direct API testing during development, we also hit Dynamo's Responses API directly:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "<model>",
    "input": "Summarize the router design briefly."
  }'
```

The Anthropic-facing frontend configuration used in these experiments looked like this:

```bash
python -m dynamo.frontend \
  --http-port 8000 \
  --enable-anthropic-api \
  --strip-anthropic-preamble \
  --dyn-reasoning-parser nemotron_nas
```

All experiments in the artifact set ran against `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4` on a single B200 in aggregated serving mode. That caveat matters. Some of the strongest results below are correctness results with clear systems implications; others are quantitative. We try to distinguish those cleanly.

## The DGD Settings That Actually Matter

One thing that became obvious while doing this work is that the speedups do not come from "serving the right model" alone. A harness-friendly deployment needs a specific set of frontend and worker settings turned on together. The reference DGD we used for this is [`nemotron3-nvfp4-vllm-b200.yaml`](/Users/mkosec/work/dynamo-ai-workflows/configs/dgd/nemotron3-nvfp4-vllm-b200.yaml).

On the frontend side, the key settings are:

- `--enable-anthropic-api` so Claude Code and OpenClaw can talk to Dynamo over the API shape they expect.
- `DYN_STRIP_ANTHROPIC_PREAMBLE=1` so Claude Code's billing header does not destroy prefix stability.
- `DYN_ENABLE_STREAMING_TOOL_DISPATCH=1` so tool readiness is emitted as structured stream state rather than inferred from deltas.

On the worker side, the important settings in this deployment are:

- `--dyn-tool-call-parser <parser>` and `--dyn-reasoning-parser <parser>` so tool calls and reasoning blocks are reconstructed in the model-specific format the harness actually needs.
- `--enable-chunked-prefill`, `--async-scheduling`, and a sufficiently large batching envelope such as `--max-num-seqs` and `--max-num-batched-tokens`, because the harnesses in this post generate long-prefill, multi-turn traffic rather than short single-shot prompts.
- The model-specific runtime settings that make the chosen backend viable at all for this workload. In our vLLM deployment that included expert parallelism, FP8 KV cache, and the speculative decoding configuration used for Nemotron-3.

It is worth being explicit about what is not part of this story. Secrets such as `HF_TOKEN` obviously need to be provided in your own environment, but they are not what unlocks the harness-side wins. The harness-relevant switches are the API mode, preamble stripping, streaming dispatch, and the correct parser and scheduler configuration.

TODO: once the final post is closer to done, add a compact "minimum DGD knobs" snippet derived from this config and cross-reference the relevant PRs for each setting.

## Prompt Stability Is Cache Work

Claude Code sends a lot of reusable prompt scaffolding. That is exactly what you want for KV reuse if the prefix stays stable. The problem is that Claude Code also prepends a session-specific billing header near the very front of the system prompt:

```text
x-anthropic-billing-header: cc_version=0.2.93; cch=abc123def456;
You are Claude Code, an interactive CLI tool...
```

On Anthropic's managed API, this is fine. On a prefix-matched KV cache, it is poison. A varying line at position zero means every new session starts from a different token prefix, so the stable instructions and tool definitions behind it never line up cleanly for reuse.

That is why Dynamo added `--strip-anthropic-preamble`. The fix is mechanically small and operationally important: remove the unstable billing header before tokenization so that the stable prompt starts at token zero.

```rust
fn strip_billing_preamble(system: &mut Option<SystemContent>) {
    if let Some(content) = system {
        let trimmed = content.text.trim_start();
        if trimmed.starts_with("x-anthropic-billing-header:")
            && let Some(newline_pos) = trimmed.find('\n')
        {
            content.text = trimmed[newline_pos + 1..].to_string();
        }
    }
}
```

The artifact set gave us a clean before-and-after story here.

First, the Anthropic baseline. Via cc-proxy in passthrough mode, a 6-request Claude Code session produced `53,992` cache creation tokens and `215,102` cache read tokens. After the first request, the session is effectively all cache reads. That is what good harness behavior looks like: one cold write, then repeated reuse of the same high-value prefix.

Second, the Dynamo-side measurement. On a localhost B200 run with a 52K-token prompt, keeping the per-session header in the prefix produced `911ms` TTFT. Removing that header before tokenization brought TTFT down to `169ms`. On this workload, the unstable header costs `743ms` per request and turns a reusable system prompt into a cold prefill.

We also verified the control case: a prompt with no extra header lands at the same fast path as the stripped version. That is useful as validation, but it is not the main comparison. The real question is whether the per-session header stays in the prefix or gets removed before tokenization.

That is the important framing for this section. Anthropic is the baseline for how the harness is meant to behave. Dynamo's result is the systems lesson: a harness quirk that looks incidental at the API boundary can destroy cache reuse if it perturbs the prefix too early.

Claude Code gave us a clean example of how harness semantics become serving semantics. On Anthropic's API, the billing preamble is absorbed into managed prompt caching and effectively disappears as an operational concern. On Dynamo, the same line sits at the front of a prefix-matched KV cache. Left untouched, it turns every session into a new prompt. Strip it before tokenization, and the system prompt becomes shareable again across requests and even across sessions that would otherwise differ only in that header.

![Prompt stability versus TTFT on a 52K-token prefix. Stable and stripped prefixes land at ~168-169ms TTFT; a varying prefix jumps to ~912ms.](./agentic-harnesses-cache-effect-clean.png)

TODO: add Dynamo-side cache hit or cache-read/cache-write accounting for the "header kept" vs "header removed before tokenization" comparison once those measurements land.

## Reasoning Fidelity Is KV Correctness

Interleaved reasoning is easy to mistake for a rendering problem. It is not. It is a prompt reconstruction problem, which makes it a KV correctness problem.

If a model generates:

```text
<think>reasoning_0</think> tool_call_0 <think>reasoning_1</think> tool_call_1
```

then the next turn has to replay that assistant output in the same structural order. If the replay path flattens all reasoning before all tool calls:

```text
<think>reasoning_0 reasoning_1</think> tool_call_0 tool_call_1
```

the visible meaning may look similar, but the token sequence is different. That means the KV prefix computed during generation no longer matches the prefix seen on replay.

Dynamo's fix was to preserve reasoning as ordered segments rather than one flattened string:

```rust
pub enum ReasoningContent {
    Text(String),
    Segments(Vec<String>),
}
```

The contract matters more than the type name. `segments[i]` is the reasoning that appeared before `tool_calls[i]`, and `segments[N]` is any trailing reasoning after the last tool call. That preserves the original token order instead of reconstructing a lossy approximation.

This round-trip was broken until [PR #7358](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/7358). The bug had three layers:

1. **Double parsing**: the Anthropic streaming handler applied a second reasoning parser on top of the engine stream, which already had reasoning correctly split. The second parser re-classified all content as reasoning.

2. **Silent drop**: chat templates only reference `{{ message.content }}` — they ignore `reasoning_content`. Without explicit injection, the model never saw its own prior chain-of-thought. The fix injects `reasoning_content` back into `content` as `<think>` blocks before template rendering, on both the Rust preprocessor path (`ModelInput::Tokens`) and the Python worker path (`ModelInput::Text`). Templates that natively handle `reasoning_content` (Nemotron, Qwen3) are detected at load time and left alone.

3. **Template truncation**: Nemotron's chat template defaults `truncate_history_thinking` to `true`, which strips `<think>` content from all assistant turns before the last user message. This is correct for non-agentic chat (saves context window) but wrong for tool-calling flows where the model needs its prior reasoning. NVIDIA's own SWE training pipeline sets `truncate_history_thinking: false` — the model was trained to see historical reasoning in agentic contexts. The Anthropic handler now passes this flag automatically when a reasoning parser is configured.

This section is strongest as a structural argument, and the post should say that plainly. The artifact set supports the claim that incorrect reconstruction breaks the prefix. It does not yet support a strong latency number on the measured deployment. The prompts are small, the deployment is aggregated, and the timing signal is noisy. The important result is not "we saved X milliseconds." It is that a replay path can look fine to a human and still be wrong for the cache.

That is what made this bug class interesting. A flattened replay can render correctly, pass a casual eyeball test, and still be functionally wrong for KV reuse. Cache reuse depends on token order, not on whether two prompts feel semantically equivalent. Preserving interleaved reasoning and tool calls was therefore less about pretty transcripts and more about making turn `N+1` look exactly like turn `N` did to the cache.

```text
Original generation:    [think][r0][/think][tool0][think][r1][/think][tool1]
Correct reconstruction: [think][r0][/think][tool0][think][r1][/think][tool1]  -> cache match
Flat reconstruction:    [think][r0][r1][/think][tool0][tool1]                  -> prefix diverges
```

As we push harder on disaggregated serving, this becomes more important, not less. When the prefix has to survive movement across workers and storage tiers, prompt shape stops being an API nicety and becomes part of the cache key story.

TODO: replace the structural close to this section with a stronger quantitative result once the longer-prefix or disaggregated reasoning-order experiment lands.

## Streaming Actionable State

Streaming tokens is not enough for harnesses. Agent loops need actionable state as soon as it exists: completed tool calls, completed reasoning blocks, and token accounting that clients can trust while the stream is still in flight.

The original intuition here was that early dispatch might show up as an obvious latency win. The artifact set points to a more careful and more interesting conclusion. Dynamo's streaming dispatch work is primarily about structure, not about a large measured wall-time reduction on the current workload.

Without dispatch, the harness sees a regular token stream and has to infer when a tool call is complete by accumulating deltas and waiting for enough structure to be present. With dispatch enabled, Dynamo can emit a typed SSE side channel:

```text
event: tool_call_dispatch
data: {"choice_index":0,"tool_call":{"index":0,"id":"call-...","type":"function","function":{"name":"calculator","arguments":"{\"expression\":\"42 * 17\"}"}}}
```

That event tells the harness, in one shot, that the tool call is ready to execute. No client-side delta assembly, no guessing whether the arguments are complete, and no custom parser living inside the harness.

The important nuance is that we should not oversell the current timing result. On this measured workload, dispatch does not produce a compelling end-to-end wall-time win by itself. What it does do is turn tool readiness into an explicit protocol event instead of an inference the client has to reconstruct from token deltas.

That matters more than it sounds. A tool call is a state transition, not just another substring in the stream. When the server can tell the harness exactly when that transition happens, the harness gets something reliable to build against. This simplifies clients immediately and creates a cleaner base for future overlap between tool execution and model generation when the workload actually has room for it.

![Representative streaming timeline without dispatch. The key phase boundary is not "stream ended" but "tool call became structurally complete."](./agentic-harnesses-timeline-no-dispatch.png)

We are still tightening the stronger version of this story with additional experiments, especially around tool execution overlap and more complex reasoning traces. For now, the safe claim is the right one: streaming dispatch makes actionable state explicit.

TODO: update this section once the stronger streaming tool-call experiment lands. In particular:
- decide whether we now have a real wall-time overlap story or should keep this section purely structural
- add the best measured workload and replace the current cautionary language if the data supports it
- consider adding a second figure if the new experiment is materially clearer than the current timeline

## Anthropic and Claude Code API Fidelity

Claude Code compatibility is more than text generation behind an Anthropic-shaped endpoint. The harness depends on a collection of smaller behaviors that are easy to miss in ad hoc testing:

- model metadata at both `GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1/models/{model_id}`
- correct handling of slashed model IDs
- useful `input_tokens` in `message_start`
- proper thinking blocks
- acceptance of `cache_control`
- response shapes that track the Anthropic API closely enough for clients not to trip over them

The fixes in this area were not glamorous, but they mattered. Claude Code does not stop at `GET /v1/models`; it also retrieves the specific connected model. That means the route has to handle identifiers like `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4` without treating the slash as a path-segmentation bug. Likewise, a field like `input_tokens` in `message_start` can look minor until you realize the client reads that event early and uses it for context accounting before the stream is over.

This is a good example of harness compatibility being more than "the field exists somewhere." Retrieval path, identifier handling, response shape, and timing all matter. A backend can be broadly Anthropic-flavored and still be just off enough to make a harness feel brittle.

The right tone for this section is checklist-driven rather than benchmark-driven. The artifact set already has the useful table: what Claude Code expects, what Dynamo returned, and which details turned out to matter in practice. The throughline is simple. Claude Code support stopped feeling hypothetical once Dynamo behaved like a backend the harness could reason about, not just one that could generate the next token.

TODO: add one concrete before/after API snippet here once the final fidelity fixes and exact examples are settled.

## Responses and Codex Fidelity

The Codex-facing version of the same problem lives on the `v1/responses` side. Passing compliance tests is not enough if realistic replay and field preservation are lossy.

The clean architectural idea here is Dynamo's `ResponseParams` path. Instead of letting a Responses request collapse into chat completions and then trying to reconstruct the missing pieces afterward, Dynamo extracts the client-facing response parameters up front, preserves them through the internal conversion, and merges them back into the final response object.

That turns the internal conversion path from an hourglass into a controlled translation layer. Fields that the engine does not care about, such as `instructions`, `store`, `truncation`, or input-item metadata, do not silently vanish just because the internal runtime speaks a chat-completions-shaped dialect.

The easiest way to see the difference is to look at the request path itself:

```text
Client Request (Responses API)
│
├─► ResponseParams --------------------------► Response echo
│   (model, tools, instructions, etc.)         (preserved verbatim)
│
└─► Internal conversion
    │
    └─► ChatCompletions-shaped request
        │
        │ Fields that would otherwise get lost here:
        │ - input item `id` and `status`
        │ - `previous_response_id`
        │ - `store`, `truncation`, `service_tier`
        │ - original `reasoning` and tool config shape
        │
        └─► Engine output
            │
            └─► Merge engine output + ResponseParams
                │
                └─► Final Responses object
```

Codex surfaced a different failure mode than Claude Code. The issue was not whether Dynamo could generate the next token. It was whether a realistic Responses request could survive an internal round-trip without losing the fields that made it a Responses request in the first place. Preserving those fields turned out to be an architectural concern, not just a serializer concern.

This section should stay shorter than the Claude Code sections. One diagram and one concrete replay example are enough. The important point is that protocol fidelity on the Responses side is still part of the serving problem. A lossy conversion path quietly erases the structure the harness depends on.

TODO: add the final field-preservation diagram or one realistic replay example from the Responses artifact set.

## Closing the Loop

The architecture from the first post only pays off if the harness-facing layer preserves enough structure for the router and the cache to exploit it. That is the connective tissue between these two posts.

Prompt stability affects KV reuse. Replay fidelity affects whether the next turn can hit cache at all. Stream semantics affect when the harness can act. Metadata fidelity affects whether the client can manage context and model selection correctly. None of that is a thin compatibility shim over the "real" serving stack. For agentic workloads, it is part of the serving stack.

For agentic workloads, protocol fidelity is performance work.
