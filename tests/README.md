# Dynamo Testing Guidelines

This document provides instructions for organizing, marking, and running tests in the Dynamo project. Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability across the test suite.

Dynamo has three areas of tests and checks:

1. **[Rust Testing](#rust-testing)** -- Covers the Rust crates under `lib/`. Has unit and integration tests. CI also enforces format, lint, and license checks before merge.
2. **[Python Testing (pytest)](#python-testing-pytest)** -- Covers Python components and cross-component workflows. Has unit, integration, and E2E tests. Uses pytest markers to select tests by lifecycle stage, hardware, and framework.
3. **Miscellaneous checks** -- Format (`cargo fmt`, `ruff`), lint (`clippy`, `pre-commit`), license (`cargo-deny`), unused dependencies (`cargo machete`), doc build (`cargo doc`). These run as part of CI and are documented in [Running Rust Checks and Tests](#running-rust-checks-and-tests).

All tests run inside containers. See the [Container Development Guide](../container/README.md) for how to build and launch one.

Each area can have one or more of the following types of tests:

1. **Unit** -- Exercises a single function, class, or module in isolation. No external services, no GPU. Each test typically runs in milliseconds; all unit tests combined may take <5 minutes.
2. **Integration** -- Wires multiple components together using **mock engines** (`dynamo.mocker`) and **real infrastructure** (ETCD for service discovery, NATS for messaging, if enabled). Validates that the router, planner, frontend gRPC, and similar subsystems work together without launching a real inference engine. No GPU required. Each test typically runs in seconds; all integration tests combined may take <30 minutes.
3. **End-to-End (E2E)** -- Starts a **real inference engine** (vLLM, SGLang, or TRT-LLM), sends requests through the frontend, and validates responses. Requires GPU. Each test typically runs in minutes; the full E2E suite may take several hours.

It is absolutely important to be mindful of how long a test you write takes. Slow tests have a compounding cost: they burn GPU-hours in CI (GPUs are expensive and shared), they discourage engineers from running suites locally (so bugs slip through to CI), and they slow down the entire team's development velocity. A test suite that takes too long becomes a test suite that nobody runs. When adding or modifying tests, include a per-test time estimate in your PR description -- CI GPU resources are limited and these estimates help the team schedule tests across pre-merge, nightly, and weekly pipelines.

Timings in this document are approximate, measured on a 32-core machine as of Q1 2026. They will vary with hardware and codebase size.

- Place **unit/integration tests** for a component in its `tests/` subfolder under `components/src/dynamo/<component>/tests/`.
- Place **end-to-end (E2E) tests** and cross-component tests in `tests/`.
- Name test files as `test_<component>_<flow>.py` for clarity.

### Test Types and Locations

## Test Marking: How to Mark Tests

Markers are required for all tests. They are used for test selection in CI and local runs.

### Marker Requirements
- Every test must have at least one **Lifecycle** marker, and **Test Type** and **Hardware** markers.
- **Component/Framework** markers are required as applicable.

### Marker Table
| Category                | Marker(s)                                                        | Description                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Lifecycle [required]    | pre_merge, post_merge, nightly, weekly, release                  | When the test should run           |
| Test Type [required]    | unit, integration, e2e, benchmark, performance, stress, multimodal | Nature of the test               |
| Hardware [required]     | gpu_0, gpu_1, gpu_2, gpu_4, gpu_8, h100                         | Number/type of GPUs required       |
| VRAM Requirement        | max_vram_gib(N)                                                              | Peak VRAM in GiB (with 10% safety). The pytest invocation can use `--max-vram-gib=N` to select only tests that fit on the available GPU. Does not prevent running on smaller GPUs (that will OOM). Use `profile_pytest.py` to measure. |
| Component/Framework     | vllm, trtllm, sglang, kvbm, kvbm_concurrency, planner, router   | Backend or component specificity   |
| Infrastructure          | k8s, deploy, fault_tolerance                                     | Infrastructure/environment needs   |
| Execution               | parallel                                                         | Test can run in parallel with pytest-xdist. Must use dynamic port allocation (`alloc_ports`) and not share resources (e.g. filesystem) |
| Other                   | slow, skip, xfail, custom_build, model, aiconfigurator           | Special handling                   |

### Example
```python
@pytest.mark.pre_merge
@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.gpu_1
@pytest.mark.max_vram_gib(21)  # peak 18.5 GiB GPU RAM used (+10% safety: 20.4 GiB)
@pytest.mark.vllm
def test_kv_cache_behavior():
    ...
```

### Filtering by VRAM

The `max_vram_gib(N)` marker records how much GPU memory a test needs. The pytest invocation can use `--max-vram-gib=N` as a **selector** to run only tests that fit on the available GPU. Tests that exceed the budget are skipped at collection time (before any test starts). Tests without a `max_vram_gib` marker always run (no constraint assumed).

Nothing prevents you from running without this flag — but if a test needs more VRAM than is physically available, it will OOM at runtime (e.g., vLLM raises `ValueError: No available memory for the cache blocks`).

```bash
# Run only tests that fit on a 48 GiB GPU — tests needing >48 GiB are skipped
python3 -m pytest --max-vram-gib=48 tests/

# GPU tests that have no max_vram_gib marker yet — need profiling
# TODO: profile these tests and add max_vram_gib markers
python3 -m pytest -m "(gpu_1 or gpu_2 or gpu_4 or gpu_8) and not max_vram_gib" tests/

# No filter — run everything regardless of VRAM (tests that exceed available memory will OOM)
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

### Lifecycle Marker Note
Use the marker for the earliest pipeline stage where the test must run (e.g., `@pytest.mark.pre_merge`). This ensures the test is included in that stage and all subsequent ones (e.g., nightly, release), as CI pipelines select tests marked for earlier stages.

**Example:**
If a test is marked with `@pytest.mark.pre_merge`, and the nightly pipeline runs:
```bash
pytest -m "e2e and (pre_merge or post_merge or nightly)"
```
then this test will be included in the nightly run as well.

---

## Rust Testing

### Organization
- **Unit tests** are placed within the corresponding Rust source files (e.g., `lib.rs`) using `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
- **Integration tests** are placed in the crate's `tests/` directory and must be gated behind the `integration` feature.

### Running Rust Checks and Tests

Run these in order. Format and lint checks are fast; fix any issues before running tests.
These commands are derived from [`.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml`](../.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml).

```bash
# Format check (typically <5s)
cargo fmt -- --check

# Clippy lint (typically <5min first run, faster with cache)
cargo clippy --no-deps --all-targets -- -D warnings

# License check (typically <15s)
cargo-deny -L error --all-features check licenses bans --config deny.toml

# Unused dependency check (typically <15s)
cargo machete

# Compile tests without executing (typically <5min first run; catches build errors early)
cargo test --locked --no-run

# Doc tests (typically <5min)
cargo doc --no-deps && cargo test --locked --doc

# Unit tests -- most important for code correctness (typically <5min)
cargo test --locked --all-targets

# Integration tests (may require ETCD/NATS running; typically <10min)
cargo test --features integration
```


### Additional Options
- **Feature gates:** Use Cargo features to run specific test subsets, e.g. `cargo test --features planner`. Integration tests must be behind the `integration` feature gate.
- **Ignored tests:** Use `#[ignore]` to mark slow or special-case tests. Run them explicitly with `cargo test -- --ignored`.

### Example
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod kv_cache_tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_kv_cache_basic() {
        // ...
    }

    #[test]
    #[ignore]
    fn test_kv_cache_long_running() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### CI Integration
- CI runs the commands listed in [Running Rust Checks and Tests](#running-rust-checks-and-tests) across 4 workspace directories: `.`, `lib/bindings/python`, `lib/runtime/examples`, `lib/bindings/kvbm`. See [`.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml`](../.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml) for the exact steps.

---

## Python Testing (pytest)

### Prerequisites

This section assumes you are already inside a running **runtime**, **local-dev**, or **dev** container. If not, see the [Container Development Guide](../container/README.md) to build and launch one. The typical workflow is:

1. Build a development container (`render.py ...` + `docker build ...`)
2. Launch it (`run.sh ...`)
3. Inside the container, compile code and run tests

All commands below are meant to be run **inside the container**.

**Local-dev / dev containers** -- you must compile the Rust bindings before running pytest. Without this step, tests that import `dynamo._internal` will fail with `ImportError`:
```bash
cargo build --locked --features dynamo-llm/block-manager --workspace
cd lib/bindings/python && maturin develop --uv && cd -
```

**Runtime containers** -- binaries are pre-built, no compilation needed. Just run pytest.

Sanity check (optional but recommended) -- verify the environment is wired up correctly:
```bash
deploy/sanity_check.py                        # local-dev / dev containers
deploy/sanity_check.py --runtime-check-only   # runtime containers
```

### Environment Setup
- Use the dev container for consistency.
- Install dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml`.
- Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for HuggingFace downloads:
  ```bash
  export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
  ```
- Model cache is located at `~/.cache/huggingface` to avoid repeated downloads.

### Running Python Tests

Python has many markers and variations. Tests are tagged with **lifecycle** markers (`pre_merge`, `post_merge`, `nightly`) that control *when* they run in CI, and **test-type** markers (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`) that describe *what* they test.

**Local development (quick feedback)** -- run these before submitting to CI:
```bash
# Unit tests -- fastest (typically <15s)
pytest -m "unit and pre_merge" -v --tb=short

# Integration tests -- uses mock engines with real infrastructure (ETCD, NATS); no GPU needed (typically <10min)
pytest -m "integration and pre_merge" -v --tb=short

# E2E smoke test -- launches a full inference engine, sends requests, validates responses (typically <5min)
# vllm
pytest tests/serve/test_vllm.py::test_serve_deployment[aggregated] -v --tb=short
# sglang
pytest tests/serve/test_sglang.py::test_sglang_deployment[aggregated-2] -v --tb=short
# trtllm
pytest tests/serve/test_trtllm.py::test_deployment[aggregated-2] -v --tb=short
```

**Pre-merge CI equivalent** -- this is what [`container-validation-dynamo.yml`](../.github/workflows/container-validation-dynamo.yml) runs on every PR. Tests marked `parallel` run with `pytest-xdist`; the rest run sequentially:
```bash
# Parallel pre-merge tests (4 workers, CPU-only; typically <5min)
pytest -m "pre_merge and parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0" -n 4 --dist=loadscope -v --tb=short

# Sequential pre-merge tests (CPU-only; typically <10min)
pytest -m "pre_merge and not parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0" -v --tb=short
```

> **Parallel vs sequential:** CPU-only tests (`gpu_0`) marked `parallel` run with `pytest-xdist` (`-n auto` or `-n <workers>`, `--dist=loadscope`). Tests not marked `parallel`, and all GPU tests (`gpu_1`, `gpu_2`, etc.), run sequentially (no `-n` flag). See [`.github/actions/pytest/action.yml`](../.github/actions/pytest/action.yml).

**Full E2E suite** -- launches engines for every test configuration; slowest, requires GPU and a framework container (typically <30min depending on framework and model):
```bash
pytest -m "vllm and e2e and gpu_1" -v --tb=short
pytest -m "sglang and e2e and gpu_1" -v --tb=short
pytest -m "trtllm and e2e and gpu_1" -v --tb=short
```

**Post-merge equivalent** -- CI runs `(pre_merge or post_merge)` after merge, which adds slower tests on top of the pre_merge set. **Running the full post-merge suite locally can take several hours per framework** (model downloads, GPU inference, multi-GPU coordination). For day-to-day development, before you submit to CI, use the `pre_merge` commands above for quicker feedback. See [`.github/workflows/post-merge-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/post-merge-ci.yml) for exact markers:
```bash
pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and gpu_0" -n auto --dist=loadscope -v --tb=short
pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and gpu_1" -v --tb=short
```

- Run by component:
  ```bash
  pytest -m planner
  pytest -m kvbm
  ```
- Show print/log output:
  ```bash
  pytest -s
  ```
- CI runs use similar instructions from inside a container. For example, running E2E tests as part of the post-merge suite:
  ```bash
  ./container/run.sh --image $VLLM_IMAGE_NAME --name $VLLM_CONTAINER_NAME -- pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and e2e and gpu_1"
  ```

### Running tests locally outside of a container

To run tests outside of the development container, ensure that you have properly set up your environment and have installed the following dependencies in your `venv`:

```bash
uv pip install pytest-mypy
uv pip install pytest-asyncio
```

---

## CI Pipeline Overview

It is highly recommended that you run tests thoroughly on your local machine before submitting to CI. Local iteration is faster, gives you immediate feedback, and avoids burning shared CI GPU resources on avoidable failures. The following stages are what CI runs -- you can (and should) run the same commands on your machine before submitting to CI.

Source workflow files (see [`.github/workflows/`](../.github/workflows/) for the full set):
- **Pre-merge (Rust):** [`.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml`](../.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml)
- **Pre-merge (Python):** [`.github/workflows/container-validation-dynamo.yml`](../.github/workflows/container-validation-dynamo.yml)
- **Post-merge:** [`.github/workflows/post-merge-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/post-merge-ci.yml) -> [`.github/workflows/build-test-distribute-flavor.yml`](../.github/workflows/build-test-distribute-flavor.yml)
- **Nightly:** [`.github/workflows/nightly-ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/nightly-ci.yml)
- **Pytest action:** [`.github/actions/pytest/action.yml`](../.github/actions/pytest/action.yml)

### Pre-merge (every PR)

Two workflows run on every PR. See [`pre-merge.yml`](../.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml) and [`container-validation-dynamo.yml`](../.github/workflows/container-validation-dynamo.yml).

**Rust checks** (only if Rust files changed) -- runs `pre-commit`, then the full sequence from [Running Rust Checks and Tests](#running-rust-checks-and-tests) across 4 workspace dirs (`.`, `lib/bindings/python`, `lib/runtime/examples`, `lib/bindings/kvbm`): format, clippy, cargo-deny, machete, compile, doc tests, unit tests.

**Python tests** (framework-agnostic, CPU-only, inside a dynamo container):

| Stage | Marker expression | Local equivalent |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Parallel (xdist, 4 workers) | `pre_merge and parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0` | `pytest -m "pre_merge and parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0" -n 4 --dist=loadscope -v --tb=short` |
| Sequential | `pre_merge and not parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0` | `pytest -m "pre_merge and not parallel and not (vllm or sglang or trtllm) and gpu_0" -v --tb=short` |

### Post-merge (push to release branches)

Runs per framework (vllm, sglang, trtllm). Each framework goes through: **Build** -> **Test** -> **Copy to registry**. The full post-merge suite takes **several hours per framework** due to model downloads, GPU inference, and multi-GPU tests.

| Stage | What it does | Local equivalent |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Build image | Render Dockerfile, build runtime container | `container/render.py --framework=vllm --target=runtime && docker build ...` |
| Sanity check | Verify packages are installed in the image | `docker run --rm <image> /workspace/deploy/sanity_check.py --runtime-check --no-gpu-check` |
| CPU-only tests (parallel) | `(pre_merge or post_merge) and <framework> and gpu_0` | `pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and gpu_0" -n auto --dist=loadscope -v --tb=short` |
| Single GPU tests (sequential) | `(pre_merge or post_merge) and <framework> and gpu_1` | `pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and gpu_1" -v --tb=short` |
| Multi-GPU tests (sequential) | `(pre_merge or post_merge) and <framework> and (gpu_2 or gpu_4)` | `pytest -m "(pre_merge or post_merge) and vllm and (gpu_2 or gpu_4)" -v --tb=short` |

### Nightly (daily at midnight PST)

Same structure as post-merge but selects tests marked `nightly` instead of `(pre_merge or post_merge)`:
```bash
pytest -m "nightly and vllm and gpu_1" -v --tb=short
```

### Reproducing CI locally

All commands shown in the "Local equivalent" columns above are also documented in [Running Rust Checks and Tests](#running-rust-checks-and-tests) and [Running Python Tests](#running-python-tests). Run Rust commands from the repo root, repeating for each workspace dir: `.`, `lib/bindings/python`, `lib/runtime/examples`, `lib/bindings/kvbm`. Run Python commands inside a container.

---

## Additional Requirements

### Flaky Tests

Tests must be deterministic. A flaky test -- one that sometimes passes and sometimes fails without code changes -- wastes CI time and erodes developer trust in the test suite. If you encounter or introduce a flaky test:

1. **Fix it first.** Remove sources of non-determinism: set a fixed random seed, eliminate race conditions, mock network calls, avoid relying on execution order.
2. **If a fix is not immediately possible**, quarantine the test to prevent it from blocking other developers:
   - `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Flaky: <ticket link>")` -- disables the test entirely. Use when the test provides no signal in its current state.
   - `@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Flaky: <ticket link>", strict=False)` -- runs the test but does not fail the suite. Use when you still want visibility into pass/fail rates while you investigate.
   - In Rust, use `#[ignore]` with a comment explaining why.
3. **File a ticket** for every quarantined test. Flaky tests without an owner drift indefinitely.
4. **Do not leave tests quarantined for more than one sprint.** If the root cause is elusive, delete the test and rewrite it.

### Timeouts

Long-running tests **must** have an explicit timeout. A test that hangs (e.g., waiting for a model server that never starts, or a deadlocked subprocess) will block the entire CI job and waste GPU-hours for everyone.

- Use the `pytest-timeout` plugin (already in our dependencies):
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.timeout(300)  # 5 minutes
  def test_e2e_inference():
      ...
  ```
- Set the timeout to **2x-3x the observed average runtime**. This gives enough headroom for legitimate variance (model loading jitter, CPU contention) while still catching genuine hangs. For example, if a test normally completes in 90 seconds, set `@pytest.mark.timeout(240)`.
- For Rust, use `#[timeout(Duration::from_secs(300))]` or set a default timeout in `Cargo.toml`.
- In CI, the workflow also enforces a global job timeout (see workflow YAML files). Per-test timeouts catch problems earlier and with a clearer error message than a blanket job cancellation.

### Time Budgets

- If a test exceeds its time budget (see [Test Types and Locations](#test-types-and-locations)), profile it with `pytest --durations=0` and consider mocking heavy dependencies, using a smaller model checkpoint, or moving it to a nightly/weekly pipeline with `@pytest.mark.slow`.

### Time Budget Industry Practices

Our per-test time targets are informed by widely adopted test size classifications:

- **Bazel test sizes** assign concrete timeouts by size: small = 60 s, medium = 300 s (5 min), large = 900 s (15 min), enormous = 3600 s (1 hr). Tests exceeding their size's expected range trigger warnings. ([Bazel Test Encyclopedia](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/2.0.0/test-encyclopedia.html))
- **Software Engineering at Google** (Winters, Manshreck, Wright, 2020) classifies tests by resource scope: small tests run in a single process with no I/O; medium tests run on a single machine; large tests may span machines. Google targets roughly 80% unit / 15% integration / 5% E2E by test count. ([Ch. 11](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch11.html))
- **Practitioner benchmarks** (Fowler, Seemann) suggest unit tests at 1-10 ms each, integration tests at ~100 ms, and E2E tests at ~1 s for non-GPU workloads. A TDD-cycle unit suite should complete in under 10 seconds. ([Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), [TDD in 10 seconds](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/05/24/TDDtestsuitesshouldrunin10secondsorless/))

GPU and model-loading overhead means Dynamo E2E tests are inherently slower than typical web-service E2E tests. Model load time alone is often 30-120 s for large models, which is why our E2E budget is 5 minutes rather than 1 second.

## Troubleshooting

- If a test is not running, verify the filename, markers, and folder location.
- For flaky tests, see [Flaky Tests](#flaky-tests) above. Fix, quarantine with `skip`/`xfail`, and file a ticket.
- For slow or hanging tests, add `@pytest.mark.timeout()` (see [Timeouts](#timeouts)) and profile with `pytest --durations=0`.
- If model downloads fail, ensure `HF_TOKEN` is set and network access is available.
- If `ImportError: cannot import name ... from 'dynamo._internal'`, you need to compile the Rust bindings first (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).
- If coverage is insufficient, add more tests or refactor code for better testability.

## GPU VRAM Profiler (`profile_pytest.py`)

When writing or reviewing GPU tests, use `tests/utils/profile_pytest.py` to measure how much VRAM a test actually needs. The script runs the test repeatedly with different GPU memory caps and uses binary search to find the minimum VRAM required. It then prints recommended pytest markers you can copy into your test.

### How it works

The profiler sets the `_PROFILE_PYTEST_VRAM_FRAC_OVERRIDE` environment variable (a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0 of total GPU RAM) and runs the test at each probe point. It bisects between "passes" and "OOM/fails" to find the boundary. After the search, it samples `nvidia-smi` to report peak VRAM, phase analysis, and marker recommendations.

**Requirement:** The test under profile **must** honor the `_PROFILE_PYTEST_VRAM_FRAC_OVERRIDE` env var. For standalone tests that allocate CUDA memory directly, check `os.environ.get("_PROFILE_PYTEST_VRAM_FRAC_OVERRIDE")` and cap your allocation accordingly — see `tests/utils/test_mock_gpu_alloc.py` for an example.

### Engine-specific mapping

`_PROFILE_PYTEST_VRAM_FRAC_OVERRIDE` is a generic env var (float 0.0-1.0) that launch scripts translate to the engine-specific CLI flag:

| Engine  | CLI flag                         | Launch script support |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| vLLM    | `--gpu-memory-utilization`       | Implemented in `agg.sh`, `disagg.sh`, etc. |
| SGLang  | `--mem-fraction-static`          | Not yet implemented (TODO) |
| TRT-LLM | `--free-gpu-memory-fraction`    | Not yet implemented (has its own `DYN_TRTLLM_FREE_GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION`, TODO: unify) |

Scripts that already hard-code their own memory fraction (e.g. `agg_multimodal.sh` with 0.85) have a TODO to honor `_PROFILE_PYTEST_VRAM_FRAC_OVERRIDE` in the future. If the profiler detects constant VRAM across all probes (meaning the env var is ignored), it prints a warning and skips marker recommendations.

### Usage

```bash
# Default mode: binary search for minimum VRAM (recommended)
# -xvs is optional: stop on first failure, verbose, show output
python tests/utils/profile_pytest.py tests/serve/test_vllm.py::test_serve_deployment[aggregated] -xvs

# Single-pass profiling (no binary search, just measure one run using default RAM)
python tests/utils/profile_pytest.py --no-find-min-vram tests/serve/test_vllm.py::test_serve_deployment[aggregated]
```

### Example output

Recommended markers to add to your pytest. You can copy-paste this:
========================================================================
# Measured using: tests/utils/profile_pytest.py tests/serve/test_vllm.py::test_serve_deployment[aggregated]
@pytest.mark.e2e  # wall time 41.2s, loads a real model
@pytest.mark.gpu_1  # 1 GPU(s) used, peak 18.5 GiB
@pytest.mark.max_vram_gib(21)  # peak 18.5 GiB GPU RAM used (+10% safety: 20.4 GiB)
@pytest.mark.timeout(124)  # 3x observed 41.2s

  WARNING: Wall time 41.2s is too slow for pre_merge (> 20s). Consider post_merge or nightly instead.
  WARNING: Will OOM on edge/embedded (4 GiB).
  WARNING: Will OOM on RTX 3060/4060 (8 GiB).
  WARNING: Will OOM on T4 (16 GiB).
========================================================================
```

### How to use the recommendations

1. **Copy the `@pytest.mark.*` lines** into your test function or `pytestmark` list.

2. **VRAM marker** — `max_vram_gib(N)` records the peak GPU memory the test needs (with 10% safety margin). This marker does **not** skip tests on its own — if a test runs on a GPU that is too small, it will OOM and fail hard. Use `--max-vram-gib=N` to select only tests that fit on the available GPU (see [Filtering by VRAM](#filtering-by-vram) for examples). The WARNING lines in the profiler output tell you which GPU tiers would be too small (e.g., "Will OOM on T4 (16 GiB)").

3. **Lifecycle markers** — the profiler recommends `pre_merge` only for tests under 20 seconds. For slower tests, it warns you to consider `post_merge` or `nightly` but does not choose for you — use your judgment based on how critical the test is for catching regressions early.

4. **Timeout** — the recommended value is 3x the observed wall time. Adjust upward if your test has high variance (e.g., first-run model download, flaky network).

5. **Test type** (`unit`, `integration`, `e2e`) — inferred from wall time and whether a real model was loaded. Override if you know better (e.g., a fast test that uses a mock engine is `integration`, not `e2e`).

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-find-min-vram` | Skip binary search; run a single profiling pass instead |
| `--interval N` | GPU sampling interval in seconds (default: 1.0) |
| `--baseline-seconds N` | Seconds to sample before launching pytest (default: 3.0) |
| `--teardown-seconds N` | Seconds to sample after pytest exits (default: 5.0) |
| `--csv FILE` | Write raw nvidia-smi samples to a CSV file |
| `--no-recommend` | Suppress marker recommendations |
